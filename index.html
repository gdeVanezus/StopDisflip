    <p class="text-center mt-5 text-white font-extrabold mx-5">We are launching a flash mob <span class='magic-hover magic-hover__square'>#StopDisflip</span>. The purpose of this flash mob is to show the public the real side of the Disflip project and the actions of its owners and team members.</p>
    <p class="text-center mt-5 text-white font-extrabold mx-5">On December 24 at 1:12 p.m., a powerful attack began on their part against EYERCORD services, which continues even now at these moments while you read this post. This is the most powerful attack in the entire history of EYERCORD. Unfortunately, our defense was unable to withstand this attack and was breached. We are already working to restore services, but for now we want to reach caring people.</p>
    <p class="text-center mt-5 text-white font-extrabold mx-5">Such attacks interfere with any project, any business, even an ordinary person who does anything on the Internet. By carrying out this attack, the owners and members of the Disflip team are leaving more than a thousand servers without protection and community moderation methods, leaving community owners from promoting their servers, and exposing Discord users to threats who cannot use Blacklist to check the people they communicate with. This attack does not only harm EYERCORD - it primarily harms ordinary people.</p>
    <p class="text-center mt-5 text-white font-extrabold mx-5">We believe that this should not be ignored. You can help spread this information by setting a username on servers where Disflip is located with the hashtag <span class='magic-hover magic-hover__square'>#StopDisflip</span> and a Discord profile status. You can also spread information about this attack on your servers, among your friends and acquaintances, etc.</p>
